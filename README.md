# SparkHackathon2019
My group's product for Spark Hackathon 2019.

# Hackathon Prompt
Design a product to help establish smart mega cities around the world.

# My Product Details
My group designed a product to help companies become as green as possible. It takes into account a variety of factors (i.e., # of factories the company has) to give it a "Zoom-score". If the company decides to purchase our second package, along with the score, they also get some advice on how to become more environmentally-friendly.
